# SwiftOS

SwiftOS is a GNU/Linux distribution made from scratch. It uses the brand new "birdy" package manager which allows you to download packages from our official servers and third-party servers. It uses the Simple Desktop Display Manager (SDDM) and KDE Plasma 6 desktop environment. Both SDDM and KDE use the breeze theme. It uses the SystemV init system and [birdy](https://github.com/swiftosproject/birdy-rust-frontend) package manager. For updates join our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/2DEmQnQMwx).
